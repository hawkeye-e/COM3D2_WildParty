# COM3D2_WildParty

Wild Party is a mod trying to add new custom scenario to COM3D2.<br>
Everything is possible!<br>

For details or screenshots please refer to (https://hawkeye0.blogspot.com/)

## Features

- Add a new scenario for throwing an orgy party with your maids!


## Installation
1. Download the plugin from [Releases](https://github.com/hawkeye-e/COM3D2_WildParty/releases)
2. Extract the zip file and copy to the "BepInEx\plugins" folder in your installation directory

## Note:
1. The only scenario now is NTR based. If you have NTR blocked on, this mod is currently doing nothing for you.
2. The mod is developed in version 3.39.1. It may not be applicable to the latest version 3.41.x.
3. It is unlikely to work in COM3D2 3.0 body / VR / Chu-B Lip.
4. Major DLCs are required. For the current scenario, X1 Dark (X1æ”¹) is necessary.
